# Tierisch Menschlich — Podcast

## Rasseportrait

This project is a fan project in dedication to the [Tierisch Menschlich](https://plus.rtl.de/podcast/tierisch-menschlich-der-podcast-mit-hundeprofi-martin-ruetter-und-katharina-adick-m5iuweomug8fv) podcast by Martin Rütter and Katharina Adick. It aims to provide a curated list of all episodes featuring the Rasseportrait, a deep dive into a particular dog breed.

I am in no way authorized or asked to provide this list of episodes, nor am I in any way affiliated with the project or the people infolved. In case anyone from RTL or from the podcast would like me to take this offline, make a change or transfer the content anywhere: I'm happy to oblige, just [drop me a line](mailto:info@tobiaswinkler.berlin).

All images are generated by [Midjourney AI](https://www.midjourney.com).

### Participation

In case I made an error somewhere or a picture could be improved: The project is fairly simple and anyone is invited to provide pull requests.

When a pull request is merged, I shall push the change into the github pages branch, which will automatically deploy the change into <https://hurrtz.github.io/rasseportrait/>

### Current status

The list should be well and about till **episode 157** (inclusive).
